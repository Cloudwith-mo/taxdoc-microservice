# Textract Query Limit Solution

## Current Status ✅

**Problem Solved**: The 502 error was fixed and we now have a working W-2 processor with 10 queries that successfully calls Textract without exceeding limits.

**Current Results**:
- ✅ 10 queries loaded and sent to Textract
- ✅ 9 query results returned from Textract  
- ✅ 78 key-value sets and 2 tables found
- ❌ Query result parsing needs fixing (relationship structure issue)

## To Increase Query Limit

### Option 1: AWS Support Case
```bash
aws support create-case \
  --subject "Textract AnalyzeDocument Query Limit Increase" \
  --service-code "textract" \
  --severity-code "normal" \
  --category-code "service-limit-increase" \
  --communication-body "Request to increase max queries per AnalyzeDocument call from ~15 to 50+ for comprehensive W-2 processing. Account: 995805900737"
```

### Option 2: Service Quotas Console
1. Go to AWS Console → Service Quotas
2. Search for "Amazon Textract" 
3. Look for query-related quotas
4. Request increase

### Option 3: Contact AWS Account Team
If you have an AWS account manager or TAM, they can expedite quota increases.

## Current Working System

The system now successfully:
1. **Processes W-2 documents** without 502 errors
2. **Calls Textract** with 10 queries within limits
3. **Gets query results** from Textract (9/10 queries returned results)
4. **Extracts forms and tables** (78 KV pairs, 2 tables found)

## Next Steps

1. **Fix query result parsing** - The relationship mapping between QUERY and QUERY_RESULT blocks needs correction
2. **Test with real W-2** - Once parsing is fixed, should extract 8-10 fields instead of 0
3. **Request quota increase** - To get full 30+ query comprehensive extraction
4. **Add regex fallbacks** - For fields that queries miss (Box 12, checkboxes)

## Expected Results After Fix

Instead of:
```
Extracted Fields: 0
```

Should get:
```
Extracted Fields: 8-10
- Employee SSN: 123-45-6789
- Employer EIN: 12-3456789  
- Box 1 - Wages: 48,500.00
- Box 2 - Federal Tax: 6,835.00
- Box 3 - SS Wages: 48,500.00
- Box 4 - SS Tax: 3,007.00
- Box 5 - Medicare Wages: 48,500.00
- Box 6 - Medicare Tax: 703.25
- State Wages: 48,500.00
- Tax Year: 2023
```

The foundation is working - just need to fix the query result parsing logic!
