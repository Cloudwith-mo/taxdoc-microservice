# TaxDoc Expansion Roadmap: From W-2/1099 to Full Tax Automation

## Current Status: Phase 1 - W-2 and 1099 Focus ✅

**Live System**: Focused on highest-impact tax forms with 99%+ accuracy
- **Forms Supported**: W-2, 1099-NEC, 1099-INT, 1099-DIV, 1099-MISC
- **Accuracy Targets**: W-2 (99%), 1099-NEC (98%), Other 1099s (95%+)
- **Architecture**: Three-layer AI extraction (Textract → Claude → Regex)

### Why Start with W-2 and 1099s?

**High Impact, Narrow Scope**:
- Nearly every tax filer receives W-2 or 1099 forms
- Well-defined templates with structured data
- Microsoft Document Intelligence and Google Document AI already support these forms
- Immediate ROI: 90%+ reduction in manual data entry

**Key Data Fields**:
- **W-2**: Employee/employer info, wages, tax withholdings, SSN/EIN validation
- **1099s**: Payer/recipient details, income amounts, federal withholdings
- **Validation**: Built-in IRS math rules and format checks

## Phase 2: Business Expense Processing (Q2 2024)

**Target**: Receipt Scanner → Schedule C Builder

### New Document Types
- **Receipts**: Restaurant, office supplies, travel, equipment
- **Invoices**: Professional services, contractor payments
- **Business Statements**: Bank statements, credit card statements

### Technical Implementation
```python
# Receipt processing configuration
RECEIPT_CONFIG = {
    "form_type": "Receipt",
    "fields": [
        {"name": "merchant_name", "type": "text", "required": True},
        {"name": "transaction_date", "type": "date", "required": True},
        {"name": "total_amount", "type": "currency", "required": True},
        {"name": "tax_amount", "type": "currency"},
        {"name": "category", "type": "text", "validation": "irs_categories"}
    ],
    "textract_queries": [
        {"Text": "What is the merchant or business name?", "Alias": "merchant_name"},
        {"Text": "What is the transaction date?", "Alias": "transaction_date"},
        {"Text": "What is the total amount?", "Alias": "total_amount"}
    ],
    "validation_rules": [
        {"rule": "date_reasonable", "formula": "transaction_date >= '2020-01-01'"},
        {"rule": "amount_positive", "formula": "total_amount > 0"}
    ]
}
```

### Schedule C Automation
- **Input**: 1099-NEC income + categorized receipts
- **Output**: Completed Schedule C (Profit or Loss from Business)
- **Features**: IRS category mapping, expense validation, net profit calculation

### Success Metrics
- 90% receipt OCR accuracy
- Automated Schedule C generation for self-employed filers
- Integration with existing 1099-NEC processing

## Phase 3: Full 1040 E-File Hub (Q3 2024)

**Target**: Complete tax return preparation and e-filing

### Core 1040 Processing
```python
# 1040 integration configuration
FORM_1040_CONFIG = {
    "form_type": "1040",
    "data_sources": [
        {"source": "W-2", "maps_to": ["wages_line_1", "federal_withholding_line_25"]},
        {"source": "1099-INT", "maps_to": ["interest_income_line_2b"]},
        {"source": "1099-DIV", "maps_to": ["dividend_income_line_3a"]},
        {"source": "1099-NEC", "maps_to": ["other_income_line_8"]},
        {"source": "Schedule_C", "maps_to": ["business_income_line_3"]}
    ],
    "calculations": [
        {"line": "adjusted_gross_income", "formula": "sum(income_lines) - adjustments"},
        {"line": "taxable_income", "formula": "agi - standard_deduction"},
        {"line": "tax_liability", "formula": "calculate_tax(taxable_income)"},
        {"line": "refund_amount", "formula": "total_payments - tax_liability"}
    ]
}
```

### Advanced Features
- **Multi-form aggregation**: Combine all processed documents
- **Tax calculations**: Standard deduction, tax brackets, credits
- **E-file integration**: IRS MeF (Modernized e-File) system
- **State tax support**: State-specific forms and calculations

### Architecture Enhancement
```
Document Upload → Classification → Form-Specific Processing → Data Aggregation → 1040 Assembly → E-File Submission
     ↓              ↓                    ↓                      ↓                ↓              ↓
