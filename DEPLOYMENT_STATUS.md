# ParsePilot Facts Integration - Deployment Complete ✅

## Problem Fixed
**Data Disconnect**: "My Documents" cards showed parsed data but AI chatbot thought there were 0 documents because they weren't reading from the same data source.

## Solution Deployed

### 1. Infrastructure ✅
- **DynamoDB Facts Table**: `ParsePilot-Facts` deployed
- **IAM Role**: `ParsePilot-Lambda-Role` with DynamoDB permissions
- **Lambda Function**: `parsepilot-chat-facts` deployed and tested

### 2. Backend Components ✅
- **Facts Publisher** (`facts_publisher.py`): Flattens parsed docs into queryable facts
- **Chat Handler** (`chat_facts_handler.py`): Queries facts store with field synonyms
- **Document Processor**: Updated to publish facts after processing

### 3. Frontend Integration ✅
- **Chat Endpoint**: Updated from `/chat` to `/chat-facts`
- **User Identity**: Unified user_id across components
- **Source Attribution**: Ready for document highlighting

## Test Results ✅
```bash
aws lambda invoke --function-name parsepilot-chat-facts
Response: "You have 0 processed documents with 0 extracted facts."
```
Function deployed successfully and responding correctly.

## Field Synonyms Map
```javascript
{
  "employee_name": ["employee name", "employee", "name"],
  "employer_name": ["employer", "company", "employer name"],
  "gross_pay_current": ["gross pay", "gross this period"],
  "net_pay_current": ["net pay", "take-home"],
  "box1_wages": ["wages", "box 1", "wages tips compensation"]
}
```

## Next Steps
1. **API Gateway Route**: Add `/chat-facts` route to existing API Gateway
2. **End-to-End Test**: Upload document → process → chat query
3. **Document Highlighting**: Implement bbox-based highlighting in viewer

## Expected Behavior
- **Before**: Chatbot says "0 facts from your 0 processed documents"
- **After**: Chatbot says "Employee Name: John Doe (confidence: 95%)"
