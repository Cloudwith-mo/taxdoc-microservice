# TaxDoc Web App Deployment Guide

## AWS Amplify Deployment Strategy

### Why Amplify?
- **Integrated CI/CD**: Automatic builds and deployments from Git
- **Built-in Authentication**: Easy Cognito integration
- **Global CDN**: Automatic HTTPS and CloudFront distribution
- **Environment Management**: Dev/staging/prod branch deployments
- **Zero Infrastructure Management**: Fully managed hosting

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy Backend Infrastructure
```bash
# Deploy enhanced microservice with Excel generation
sam build --template infrastructure/template.yaml
sam deploy --stack-name taxdoc-stack-dev --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
```

### 2. Setup Amplify App
```bash
# Install Amplify CLI
npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli

# Initialize Amplify project
cd web-app
amplify init

# Add hosting
amplify add hosting
# Choose: Amazon CloudFront and S3

# Deploy to Amplify
amplify publish
```

### 3. Connect to Git Repository
1. Go to AWS Amplify Console
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Select the `web-app` folder as build root
4. Amplify will auto-detect the `amplify.yml` build settings

### 4. Configure Environment Variables
In Amplify Console â†’ App Settings â†’ Environment Variables:
```
REACT_APP_API_ENDPOINT=https://yjj6ifqqxi.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev
```

## API Endpoints

### Document Processing
- **POST** `/process-document` - Process uploaded document
- **GET** `/result/{doc_id}` - Get processing results
- **GET** `/download-excel/{doc_id}` - Download Excel report

### Excel Download Flow
1. User uploads document â†’ Processing complete
2. User clicks "Download Excel" â†’ API generates Excel file
3. File uploaded to S3 â†’ Presigned URL returned
4. Browser downloads file immediately
